      "description": "Your valued company is doing well, but you are afraid that traditional wisdom will become a permanent creed, hence needing a new factor. Whom should you look for? Let me help you with the title: Business Analytics Specialist. This specialist will bring the future to the present and value from the past. Amazing if you remember that \u201cThe only thing that we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history.\u201d, as the philosopher Georg Hegel famously said.\n\nIn a nutshell, a Business Analytics expert balances an in-depth understanding of statistics, IT, and programming with business insights and communication skills. The expert can analyze past business performance with the use of descriptive, exploratory, and explanatory analytics. On the other hand, he or she is able to predict future events and improve decision-making through predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and experimental analytics.\n\nHere I would like to give you another view of Business Analytics that is not shown in those job descriptions. Let\u2019s talk about a race. In this event, speed is undoubtedly critical; however, the rate of speed change, or acceleration has a more decisive influence. If you are so tired that no more acceleration is obtained when approaching the finish line, you are prone to lose as opponents speed up in their final stage. Obviously, you will win the race if you finish in the shortest time. To achieve such time, you need to be good at timing with proper acceleration during several periods.\n\nYour business is analogous to a race: power is speed; decision making is timing. In business, your power relies on 3 Ps: people, process, and product. Also note that if your power is constant, or speed is unchanged, you may be defeated in the game. A Business Analytics professional can help you build acceleration, i.e., keep your power increasing. Besides, data-driven decision-making is the ultimate goal to be expected in any Business Analytics Specialist."

      "description": "Academic study is a journey where the starting point and the destination are not as important as the experience throughout. My educational background has been incredibly valuable and rewarding for someone who returned to academics after working for nine years. On this journey, I have embraced the unfamiliar. I have adapted to many new transitions: not being in my homeland, embracing new educational values, learning in a multicultural environment, and coping with the pandemic. There has been an unprecedented shift from the traditional classes to adjusting to hybrid and flexible classes, both close-in-time and far-in-space, navigating independent yet interactive learning. Fortunately, my carefully considered choice of studying at Cambrian College brought me many valuable lessons beyond knowledge. Resilience and determination were some of the many lessons I learned from my first program of I.T. Business Analysis and my current program of Business Analytics. \n\nI have made many discoveries about myself during this process, but I feel there are three crucial self-discoveries: \n\u2022\tNever underestimate the usefulness of any learning\n\u2022\tDon\u2019t overestimate yourself\n\u2022\tSharing and caring to promote productivity and open opportunities\n\nAs I have written in a post on the Facebook group of Vietnamese students at Cambrian College, going to school does not mean paying 100% attention to studying. Learning is a process of knowledge accumulation and a self-discovery journey. You can enrich your student\u2019s life with self-reflection and out-of-textbook lessons, try to multiply findings and experiences with your social circle, and seek opportunities to apply your knowledge to solve a real problem. Now you are confident in life after graduation."

# Fetching profile data via Proxycurl's Linkedin Profile API Endpoint

LinkedIn is a powerful professional social network, and a treasure trove of data for professionals and job listings. 
Linkedin is aware of its data value and turned off public access to their API since 2015. 
To gain access to the official Linkedin API, you will need to be a Linkedin Partner.

The chances are that most companies that apply will not be approved as a Linkedin Partner. 
Thankfully, you can achieve the same effects of Linkedin API with Proxycurl's Linkedin API.

Step 1: Sign up to Proxycurl and get yourself a trial API key so you can get started immediately.

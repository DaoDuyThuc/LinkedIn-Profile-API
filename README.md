# Fetching profile data via Proxycurl's Linkedin Profile API Endpoint

Linkedin is a powerful professional social network, and a treasure trove of data for professionals and job listings. 
Linkedin is aware of its data value and turned off public access to their API since 2015. 
To gain access to the official Linkedin API, you will need to be a Linkedin Partner.

The chances are that most companies that apply will not be approved as a Linkedin Partner. 
Thankfully, you can achieve the same effects of the official Linkedin API with Proxycurl's Linkedin API.

Step 1: Sign up to Proxycurl and get yourself a trial API key so you can get started immediately.

Step 2: Check your email and get a Proxycurl API key.

Step 3: Choose a profile ID to fetch data. It is at the end of a Linkedin URL.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/profile_id

Step 4: Paste the Proxycurl API key and profile ID to the Python file PersonProfile.py and run it.

You will get the profile data as a JSON file. I have given an example of my JSON file thucdao.json.

The Proxycurl's Linkedin API is not only about people. You can explore more about companies, contacts, jobs, schools, etc. at:
